                            The majority of U.S. dachshunds have smooth coats. These coats are soft, short, shiny, and dense. They also require very little grooming.
                            Smooth-haired dachshunds (sometimes simply called smooth dachshunds) have ears that are sometimes described as “leathery looking” and relatively long hair on their bellies. </p>

                            Wire-haired dachshunds have medium-length, coarse, slightly wavy hair that gives them a “rough” appearance. They also have (amazingly cute) facial hair, which makes them pretty easy to recognize.</p>

                            Long-haired dachshunds have long, silky hair, which was likely developed to protect these hunting dogs from the elements.
                            The long hair is most noticeable on the tail, ears, neck, behind the legs, and beneath the belly. Long-haired dachshunds require frequent brushing and grooming to keep their coat in good condition.</div>
